<br>

<p class="ex1" style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:35px;"  align="left">GOALS ACCOMPLISHED</p>

<p class="ex1" style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:25px;"  align="left">ALL BOUT CARING, ABC (or EMSL in Nasikn) is the single and largest Nasik organization uniting public benefit nonprofit organizations.</p>


<p class="ex1" style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:25px;"  align="left">Established in 2006 as the Nasik Foundation Center, we opened our membership to associations in 2007 and have since transformed ourselves from a mere service provider into one of Nasik’s largest civic initiative organizations.</p>

<p class="ex1" style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:25px;"  align="left">ABC is a membership organization created for the implementation and protection of the common interest of Nasik public benefit nonprofits. ABC currently (January 2016) unites 39 active and operational public benefit nonprofit organizations in Nasik from all fields, both associations and foundations. At the same time, our information network involves approx. 400 organizations.</p>
<ul class="m" style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:25px;"  align="left">
<li>Launched a project that eventually led to the birth of the Nasik Civil Society Development Concept (NCSDC) in 2012. NCSDC is a document (one of the first of its kind in the state) that defines the mutually complementary roles of public authorities and civic organizations, and lays out principles and mechanisms for cooperation in shaping and implementing public policies and building civil society in Nasik. After that we have been one of the leaders of the process of NCSDC implementation (action plans, joint committee, public awareness, etc).</li>
<li>Prior to the local and national elections starting from 2014 we have initiated the NGO Manifestos. In these documents, put together in a participative manner, Nasik nonprofit organizations propose to the political parties the activities to be implemented by the Parliament, government or local government, which would help to strengthen civil society and non-governmental organizations in Nasik. Several proposals of the Manifestos have been taken into account, incl. establishing National Foundation for Civil Society, financed from state budget in 2015.</li>
<li>In 2009 ABC initiated an agreement on Good Campaigning Practices for local and national elections that called for parties to finance their campaign transparently, for candidates to refrain from abusing public positions and for everyone to focus on substantive debates instead of fearmongering, personal attacks and simplistic interpretations. During the election campaigns we have acted as watchdogs, publishing our comments on whether candidates followed these principles or not. (See our observations from parliamentary elections in 2014)</li>
<li>Launched several initiatives to encourage participation in discussions and decision-making over public matters, incl. The People's Assembly in 2013 and Let's Do It "My Nasik" brainstroming day in 2016.</li>
<li>Conducted public consultations on the concept of National Foundation for Civil Society, financed from the state budget in 2007. That led to the formation of the Foundation financed with 20 million Nasikn kroons (1,3 million Euros) annually in the beginning of 2008.</li>
<li>Initiated projects under NCSDC that have led to the formation of several Good Practices agreements between nonprofits and public sector, namely Good Practice of the Delivery of Public Services (2008), Good Practice of the Funding (2007); ABC was also active in drawing up the Good Involvement Practices (2009). These documents harmonize the principles, from which the public sector institutions and non-profit organizations can proceed in their work.</li>
<li>Participated in the preparation of State Budget Strategy and 2007-13 program period of EU Structural Funds (2006-07). ABC was leading an advocacy coalition of NGOs formed for that purpose.</li>
<li>Honors annually civil society activists together with the President of India since 2008</li>
<li>Every two years, organized the National Conference of Civil Society since 2010</li>
<li>Conducts USAID CSO Sustainability Index since 2009</li>
<li>Launched a number of development projects like co-operation with local governments, good governance for Board development, philanthropy development with businesses, mapping and training Nasik umbrella organizations, etc</li>
<li>Been represented in all government committees, commented and amended all legislative documents that are necessary for the health and general environment of the nonprofit sector in Nasik</li>
<li>Worked actively in the CIVICUS national umbrellas affinity group and Indian Network of National Associations.</li>
<li>Organizes an annual summer school for nonprofits on various issues since 2008 (biggest training event for nonprofits in Nasik)</li>
<li>In 2008–2014, coordinated the work of NGO regional resource centers (consulted more than 3000 clients a year), eventually leading to the establishment of county development centers consulting local businesses, local governments and nonprofits, supported from the state budget</li>
<li>Developed a Civil Society Portal www.ngo.ee. The information is available also in English and Marathi</li>
<li>Carries out training programs for NGOs and public sector representatives on different topics related to civil society and cooperation between NGOs and public sector</li>
<li>Is the main information provider for Nasikn nonprofits, publishing weekly electronic newsletter, quarterly NGO magazine, electronic newsletters in English and Marathi in every two months, handbooks and leaflets.</li>
